# domain_generation
domain name generation using LLM(llama)
by using lang-graph to build a agent which can generate domain and parse it a structured output format(dictionary)


domainName.ipynb showed the basic idea on the ideal workflow

fixed_output.ipynb try to make the llama generate relatively consistant output 

llm-agent.ipynb is the agent that can generate domain name
